~ Abstract
DIN 18009 Part 1 describes the fundamentals of the system for the
selection of design fire scenarios. The working steps can only be
regarded as indications for a performance-based design. This framework is
supposed to ensure an adequate and uniform application of the variety of
internationally available knowledge and methodologies.

In 2008, the DIN working committee NA 005-52-21 AA started its work to
standardize fire safety engineering methods in Germany. The second sub
document DIN 18009 Part 3 shall cover the design fire scenarios and
design fires. Some ideas related to methodology, requirements and
scenario-based design are presented in this article.

# INTRODUCTION

In Germany, performance-based design methods are not explicitly embedded
in national building codes. Accordingly, the major knowledge, guidance as
well as material and product performance is closely linked to the
prescriptive design approach. This approach has provided a substantial
improvement of fire safety, resulting in a quite safe situation within
the built environment at the present time. However, the increasing
individuality and complexity of modern buildings or questions related to
the conversion of existing buildings may conflict with the applicability
or fulfillment of those deemed-to-satisfy requirements. Thus, the
performance-based fire safety design has established in Germany as well.

Consequently, the international standards ar implicitly incorporated in
the German day-to-day business of FSE. The current work on the DIN 18009
framework is supposed to ensure an adequate and uniform application of
the variety of internationally available knowledge and
methodologies [@wiese2014bbt].

## Performance-based fire safety design in Germany

Fire safety design is traditionally satisfactory if the building complies
with the requirements in building codes. The accordance with the
requirements leads to a "safe" building by definition. The codes are very
constrictive to the layout and the material requirements.

Since 1978, the directive for industrial buildings [@MIndBauRL2014] in
conjunction with DIN 18230 [@DIN18230-1:2010EN] is the only native
performance-based design approach in Germany. It regulates the
determination of the required fire resistance time of components and the
acceptable fire compartment area for industrial buildings. Basic
principles for fire safety engineering are solely published in
sub-statutory reports, guidelines and specifications.

The goal of the German Fire Protection Association (GFPA) (Vereinigung
zur Förderung des Deutschen Brandschutzes e. V. -- vfdb) Section 4 "Fire
Protection Engineering" is to upgrade the modern fire protection
engineering methods developed in the last years. Further-on it is the aim
to make this upgrade available for daily applications in terms of of a
guideline [@vfdb2013EN]. In the scope of fire protection concepts, this
guideline is intended to contribute to harmonize disjointed approaches
and assumptions and to avoid erroneous measures in the application of
engineering methods.

## Standardisation activities in Germany 

In the year 2008, the DIN working committee NA 005-52-21 AA
"Brandschutzingenieurverfahren" started its work to standardize fire
safety engineering methods in Germany. The committee is also the national
mirror committee for the international respectively European committees
ISO/TC 92/SC 4 and CEN/TC 127/WG 8. The first issue of DIN 18009 Part
1 [@DIN18009-1:2016-09EN] was published in september 2016. Currently, two
working groups are framing the technical sub documents "Evacuation and
Life Safety" and "Fire Scenarios".

### DIN 18009 Part 1

DIN 18009 Part 1 is intended a basis document to standardize the
methodology in Fire Safety Engineering. It describes all characteristic
steps and necessary terms and definitions related to the design process.
In this respect, it is intended to serve as a guideline for both the
design and the inspection process. In accordance with the basic
principles of DIN 18009 Part 1, it is explicitly allowed to use other
national or international standards in order to supplement the framework.

In principal, DIN 18009 Part 1 comprises the following engineering
methodologies: performance-based, argumentative and experimental; the
emphasis is placed on the performance-based line. Irrespective of the
question and the chosen method, the fundamental proof is based on the
question if the system's resistance is greater than the minimal required
resistance for a specific influence. To encourage this concept,
guidelines for the identification of fire safety goals, performance
criteria and acceptance criteria are provided. Further on, the framework
regulates a classification of scenarios as well as the setup and
selection of the latter, see Figure [#selection_of_design_fires].
Finally, a concept for the inclusion of safety margins and guidelines for
the documentation are provided to the practitioners [@wiese2014bbt].

### DIN 18009 Part 2

The first sub document DIN 18009 Part 2 covers evacuation modeling and
the life safety assessment during fire and is currently in a first draft
state. A special focus of the draft is the identification of
representative scenarios and the related translation into parameter
samples. Regarding the established model classes to describe pedestrian
dynamics, the methodology is designated to cope with different extends of
data input and output. A variety of recommendations for data analyses,
visualisation and documentation are addressed. Selected insights related
to methodology, requirements and scenario-based design are presented
in [@Jaeger2016].

### DIN 18009 Part 3

The second sub document DIN 18009 Part 3 covers the design fire scenarios
and design fires. A special focus will be the identification of
representative scenarios, the design fires and the selection of the fire
model. The definition of explicit design fires
like [@NZ_CVM2;@NFPA101:2015] are in discussion. Some ideas related to
methodology, requirements and scenario-based design are presented in the
next section.

# SELECTION OF DESIGN FIRE SCENARIOS

## Methodology and requirements

Further identification, analysis and assessment of potential fire hazards
is usually required if the compliance with fire safety goals according to
building regulations is not possible by fulfilling prescriptive
specifications. In the course of an qualitative design analysis, the
essential boundary conditions in terms of the building type and
utilization as well as the fire protection infrastructure are to be
recorded in order to identify potential fire scenarios.

The identified hazards are assessed within a risk analysis and thus
represent the starting point for the decision of further engineering
evidence. In the subsequent quantitative analysis, the corresponding
functional requirements are derived from the respective fire safety
goals, which in turn are specified by performance criteria. Based on the
relevant scenarios, fire curves are defined, which will not be exceeded
by an actual fire event with a high degree of probability. Due to the
application of such worst-credible scenarios the implementation of
disproportionate and inefficient structural, plant and organizational
measures can be dispensed with.

Furthermore, the selection of the used calculation method for fire
simulations is of major significance. Depending on the requirements as
well as the required accuracy, the fire protection engineer can use
analytical handwriting formulas as well as simplified (zone models) and
complex simulation models (CFD).

In anticipation of standardization work on DIN 18009 Part 3, approaches
are to be found in order to systematize working sequences of the
identification and selection of design fire scenarios.

## Performance criteria

A performance-based fire protection design serves to ensure a safety
level in accordance with building regulations. The evidence should be
provided by comparing the defined performance criteria on the resistance
side $(R)$ with the respective calculation results on the action side
$(A)$. The influencing variables must be selected based on sufficiently
conservative assumptions or have to be varied within parameter studies.
In order to take account of uncertainties on the part of the individual
parameters, the calculation of corresponding partial safety coefficients
$\gamma_A$ and $\gamma_R$, is generally carried out as part of a safety
concept [@Bub1983].

~ Equation
R \cdot \gamma_R \ge A \cdot \gamma_A

Table [#tab-goals-performance] provides an example of how quantitative
and qualitative requirements can be derived from the respective fire
safety goals.

## Principles for the description of fire scenarios

A design fire scenario describes the sequence of a fire event with regard
to the effect of all parameters which influence the fire process.
Structural and technical fire protection as well as usage-specific
boundary conditions and the behavior of persons are considered. Possible
interactions and key events should be placed in a temporal context. The
selected fire scenarios are to be dimensioned in such a way that the
resulting fire events are only to be exceeded with an extremely low
probability by a real fire event. The fire sequence should be quantified
by the specification of various parameters, such as the heat release rate
or smoke yield, depending on the fire safety goals to be achieved.

The basic procedure for the selection of design fire scenarios according
to DIN 18009 Part 1 [@DIN18009-1:2015-04EN] is explained in detail below.

### Identification of fire scenarios based on building utilization

Within a qualitative analysis, the design and utilization of the
building, as well as the scope of technical fire protection systems shall
be recorded. In particular, from the type of use, potential sources of
ignition can be derived from the furniture or the stored substances.
Furthermore it is necessary to determine which fire products or which
combustion heat could be released by the substances in the event of a
fire, as well as the resulting risk to people, property values or the
load-bearing structure.

The following events must be considered by means of an individual
analysis or taking into account fire statistics:

* The most common causes of fire
* Fire scenarios causing serious damage

### Definition of critical sites for the source of fire

For individual fire scenarios, different locations are generally
considered to be the starting point of a fire with a comparable
probability. From this, those are to be selected for further
consideration, which are particularly critical regarding the fire safety
goal to be achieved. In order to verify that a successful evacuation of
the building is possible, for example, fires in the area of the escape
routes or fires which make escape routes impassable (e.g. fires in atria)
can be considered. In terms of ensuring effective fire-fighting, fire
sites are particularly relevant, which are characterized by an
extraordinary speed of propagation and which result in a high thermal
load on the load-bearing structure. Overall, fires within and outside the
building must be considered.

### Determination of the effct of factors that influence the fire developement

The influences on the course of the fire must be derived and quantified
from the structural and geometrical as well as technical fire protection
conditions. By the location and arrangement of room-closing components,
burning areas can be defined, to which the fire event can be reduced.
Furthermore, an assessment can be made as to how far a fire impact on
adjacent areas can be expected (Traveling Fire). Based on the opening
surfaces (windows, doors) including their respective opening criteria,
information about the ventilation can be obtained.

Technical fire protection measures can be used to limit unrestricted fire
spreading directly (automatic fire-extinguishing systems) and indirectly
through early fire detection and alarming of the users or the fire
brigade. The influence on the course of the fire must be determined
taking into account plant-related failure probabilities.

### Determination of the influence of the building users on the fire developement

A fire event can either be discovered and reported by a person or
automatically by appropriate detection systems. Depending on the physical
and mental condition of the building users, the respective reaction
features can be estimated for such an event. From the use of the
building, conclusions can usually be drawn to the vigilance, the ability
to act independently and the familiarity with the building of the users.

The following factors are particularly relevant to the influence on the
course of the fire:

* Danger of causing a fire
* Reaction of the building users to alarming or the detection of a fire
* Successful or unsuccessful attempts to extinguish
* Opening windows and doors

Since the reactions of the building users are extremely difficult to
estimate or are subject to large scatterings, the influences must be
taken into account by the application of appropriate safety factors.
Alternatively, conceivable scenarios can be covered by parameter studies.

### Assesment of estimated fire losses

On the basis of the previously defined fire scenarios, the respective
consequences should be estimated taking into account the respective fire
safety goals. This can be done, for example, by quantifying personal
injury or economic damage, such as damage to property or operational
failures.

### Assesment of fire risk

By combining the frequency with the consequences, a fire risk can be
determined for the individual fire scenarios. If the fire scenarios can
not be assigned to different frequencies, all fire scenarios found should
be assumed to be equally probable.

### Selection and documentation of the relevant scenarios

For a further consideration, the fire scenarios with the highest risk
should be selected. Furthermore, it may be necessary to analyze
individual unlikely scenarios in a deterministic way.

The identification and definition of design fire scenarios operates in
mutual interaction with the subsequent fire simulation, so that the
entire procedure is to be understood as an iterative process. Based on
the calculation results of the fire simulation it may be necessary to
adjust input parameters of the scenario. For example, the probable
triggering time of an automatic fire extinguishing system can only be
determined in relation to the calculated fire temperatures.

## Scenario-based design

The selection of one or more relevant design fire scenarios should be
representative of a group of potential scenarios. For the selection of
the scenarios, an assessment period is first established, which generally
corresponds to the service life of a building. All possible scenarios
must be recorded over this period. In principal, the totality of possible
fire scenarios are grouped into relevant and non-relevant scenarios. By
means of risk, non-relevant scenarios can be differentiated in bagatelle
and worst-case scenarios. The risk of a particular scenario is defined as
the product of the probability of occurrence and the amount of damage.

Additionally, a trial design may also result in unacceptable scenarios
with high risk potentials, which categorically requires a redesign.
Relevant scenarios are the centerpiece of the design process. They
comprise a set of significant scenarios which are supposed to be
represented by design scenarios. The outlined classification is
illustrated in Figure [#risk].

~ Figure {#risk; caption: "Scenario classification consisting of relevant scenarios"}
![risk] 
~

[risk]: images/risk.pdf "Scenario classification consisting of relevant scenarios" {width:100%}

An assessment of the scenarios can be carried out in the course of a risk
analysis with deterministic methods, for example by expert knowledge or
by probabilistic methods.

## Fire modeling

Design fires as a basis for fire simulations are described by means of a
time-dependent heat release. In addition to normative fire curves, it is
also possible to refer to experimentally determined fire sequences or
engineering procedures. Standardized procedures for calculating heat
release curves regarding different fire safety goals (see DIN
18232-2 [@DIN18232-2:2007-11], DIN EN 1991-1-2 [@DINEN1991-1-2:2010-12EN]
or DIN EN 1991-1-2/NA [@DINEN1991-1-2NA:2015-09EN]) are characterized in
particular by the following input variables:

* Maximum fire area
* Fire load
* Heat release rate
* Fire spread rate

Depending on the fire safety goals to be achieved or the functional
requirements derived therefrom, it may be necessary to define a detailed
combustion reaction in order to take account of the formation of toxic
fire products or soot.

The approach of a fire curve with a square increase in heat release, a
constant fully-developed fire stage and a linear decay stage is suitable
for many fire protection verifications. In this case, an radial fire
propagation is assumed, which is limited by the maximum fire load, the
ventilation conditions or extinguishing measures. After 70\% of the
calculated fire load has been burned, the heat release decreases linearly
to zero.

design fire scenarios in seven working steps (see

# APPLICATION EXAMPLE

## Description of Building

The example shows a three-storey building with differently used areas.
The ground floor includes a lobby, a restaurant and offices. The floors
are connected by an atrium and open stairs. All floors above the ground

The building is built in solid construction, the individual units are
separated from the atrium by glass elements. The roof structure, which at
the same time forms a bracing element of the overall structure, is
designed as an unprotected steel frame construction.

## Project scope, goals and performance criteria

The following fire safety goals can be derived from the requirements of
the German Model Building Code (MBO) [@MBO2016]:

* Prevent the fire from starting
* Prevent the spread of fire ans smoke
* Enabling of escape and rescue
* Enabling of effective fire-fighting measures

Since some of the stated objectives can not be achieved by fulfilling
prescriptive requirements, appropriate compensation measures must be
taken or evidence must be provided to ensure an equivalent level of
safety.

In order to enable effective fire fighting, a sufficient stability of the
load-bearing structure in case of fire must be ensured. The required fire
resistance of at least 90 minutes according to building regulations can
not be guaranteed by the unprotected steel construction without further
evidence. The evidence of compliance with the fire safety goal shall be
provided by an computational analysis based on a standardized natural
fire according to DIN EN 1991-1-2/NA [@DINEN1991-1-2NA:2015-09EN].

## Exploration of fire scenarios

### Determination of fire scenarios

Due to the utilization, for example, defective electrical equipment such
as computers or kitchen equipment as well as the misbehavior of persons
can be identified as possible causes of fire. The individual office units
as well as the restaurant or the lobby have to be considered as potential
locations for the development of a fire. With regard to the fire safety
goal to be fulfilled, in particular, scenarios are to be considered which
are expected to result in a high thermal load on the roof structure.
Taking into account the higher fire load as well as the location, the
closer examination is reduced to a fire event in one of the office rooms
on the second floor.

### Selection of fire scenarios

Within the second floor, a total of three areas of different sizes, which
can be viewed as potential fire areas, are formed by room closing
components. Since the probability of occurrence for a specific fire event
can not be quantified in detail, it must be assumed to be identical for
the three office units because of the comparable utilization. The risk
analysis is thus limited to the selection of scenarios with the greatest
possible impact.

Taking into account the maximum possible fire area ($A_f = 379\ m^2$) as
well as the ventilation conditions, a full fire of the office unit 2 can
be identified as the decisive design fire scenario with regard to the
maximum heat release as well as the fire duration.

### Design fire

Inputs that are related to building utilization such as heat release
rate, fire spread rate and fire load density are calculated according to
DIN EN 1991-1-2[@DINEN1991-1-2:2010-12EN;@DINEN1991-1-2NA:2015-09EN]. The
consideration of uncertainties and failure probabilities of human and
technical nature are covered by the safety concept according to DIN EN
1991-1-2/NA [@DINEN1991-1-2NA:2015-09EN] (see Table [#tab-design_fire]).

The consequences for human life, as well as economic and environmental
damage to be expected in the event of a failure of the load-bearing
structure, can be estimated depending on the utilization of the building.
As a result, a required reliability and a permissible failure probability
can be determined. The permissible failure probability $p_f$ of the
load-bearing structure in relation to one year (office building) can
therefore be defined as:

~ Equation
p_f =1.300e-05
~

The probability of occurrence $p_{fi}$ of a destructive fire in a
utilization unit in a reference period of 1 year can be determined as
follows:

~ Equation
p_{fi} = p_1 \cdot p_{2,1} \cdot p_{2,2} \cdot p_3 = 6.200e-03 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 1 = 6.200e-04
~

From this the conditional failure probability in case of fire $p_{f,fi}$
and the linked reliability index $\beta_{fi}$ can be determined as
follows:

~ Equation
p_{f,fi} = \frac{p_f}{p_{fi}} = \frac{1.300e-05}{{6.200e-04}} = 2.097e-02
~

~ Equation
\beta_{fi} = -\phi^{-1}(p_{f,fi}) = -\phi^{-1}({2.097e-02}) = 2.034
~

$\phi( \ )$ is the function of  standard-normal distribution and $\phi^{{-1}}$ is the inverse function of standard-normal distribution.
The partial safety coefficients for heat release rate $\gamma_{fi,\dot{Q}}$ as well as the fire load density $\gamma_{fi,q}$ can be calculated as a function of the required reliability $\beta_{fi}$ index:

~ Equation
\gamma_{fi} = \frac{1-V \cdot 0.78 \cdot [0.5772+ln(-ln(\phi(\alpha \cdot \beta_{fi})))]}{1-V \cdot 0.78 \cdot [0.5772+ln(-ln(0.9))]}
~

The partial safety coefficients can be calculated with the variation
coefficients $V_q = 0.3$ (fire load density) and $V_q = 0.2$ (heat
release rate). The sensitivity coefficient is assumed to be
$\alpha = 0.6$ so that the following partial safety coefficients can be
calculated:

~ Equation
\gamma_{fi,\dot{Q}} = 0.986
~

~ Equation
\gamma_{fi,q} = 0.981
~

The Eurocode specifies the characteristic values for the fire load
density ${q}_{f,k}$ and the heat release rate per unit area $RHR_f$ as
90\% quantile. For office areas, the following values should be assumed:

~ Equation
RHR_f = 0.25 MW/m^2
~

~ Equation
{q}_{f,k} = 584 MJ / m^2
~

In general, a combustion effectiveness of $\chi = 0.8$ can be assumed for
mixed fire load. The respective design values can be obtained by
multiplication with the corresponding partial safety coefficients:

~ Equation
{q}_{f,d} = \chi \cdot {q}_{f,k} \cdot \gamma_{fi,{q}} = 0.8 \cdot 584 \cdot 0.981 = 572.9  MJ/m^2
~

~ Equation
\dot{Q}_{max,d} = A_f \cdot RHR_f \cdot \gamma_{fi,\dot{Q}} =379 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 0.986 = 93.42 MW
~

Figure [#fig-hrr] shows the change in heat release for the design fire as
a function of time.

# CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

The article is intended to provide an overview of the current status
regarding fire scenario assessment in Germany. First, a brief explanation
of the safety level defined by the German building codes and the
associated fire safety goals is given. Furthermore the current state of
standardization work on DIN 18009 Part 1-3 as well as the content of the
respective parts is described.

The recently published Part 1 of DIN 18009 already describes the
fundamentals of the system for the selection of design fire scenarios.
The described working steps for the identification of possible scenarios
up to selection of relevant design scenarios can only be regarded as
indications for a performance-based design.

Irrespective of the fire safety goal to be achieved or the performance
criteria derived therefrom, the fire event represents the starting point
of each fire simulation. Since the factors influencing the fire
development are extremely difficult to estimate and subject to a large
scatter, a real fire event can never be predicted exactly. It is thus all
the more important to ensure that the selected boundary conditions cover
all conceivable fire events with a sufficient safety margin.

The application of natural fire scenarios in the course of a
performance-based design in Germany is in principle a deviation from
building regulations. Furthermore the decision whether or not a fire
safety goal is fulfilled by a computational evidence is still with the
approving authority. Equivalence of such evidence with descriptive
specifications would be desirable as long as an identical level of safety
can be ensured. From the authors' point of view, DIN 18009 framework is a
logical and important step in this direction.

# CLOSING REMARKS

The contents of this article reflect the opinion of the authors and may
not be misinterpreted as a direct excerpt of the future standard DIN
18009-3. It may not be understood as the documentation of a complete
assessment process. It is rather supposed to record the methodological,
technical and regulative considerations made in the past months.
Furthermore we aim for an international exchange and discussion, which is
warmly welcome. The presented approaches, assumptions and conclusions may
not be misinterpreted in any context of the prescriptive regulations in
Germany.
