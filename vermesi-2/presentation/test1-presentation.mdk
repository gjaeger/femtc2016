# Introduction - Team

* Work carried out in 2014
* Led by Edmund Ang (Imperial College London), with collaborators: 
  - Guillermo Rein (Imperial College London)
  - Joaquin Peiro (Imperial College London)
  - Roger Harrison (AECOM UK)
  - Izabella Vermesi (Imperial College London)
* Special thanks to software support from Thunderhead Engineering

# Introduction - Multi-scale Modelling

* Multi-scale modelling based on Colella _et al_ [1]
* Previous work based on commercial CFD package and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes
* Multi-scale modelling using FDS6:
  - Not attempted before
  - Enabled by the FDS HVAC feature 
  - Proof of concept by Vermesi _et al_ [2] 
  - Constant flow specified at boundary
  - No coupling of jet fans to the fire behaviour

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why 

* Increasingly denser and taller buildings
  - Scarcity of land resources 
  - High rise buildings
  - Options for above ground rail or utility network limited
* Tunnel is often the more practical solution 
* Tunnels can be used for rail, roads or utilities 

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* Ventilation is needed to most tunnels
  - Life safety (fumes or CO from fire)
  - Regulating temperature (train operation)
* Three main types of ventilation system
  - Longitudinal (jet fans)
  - Transverse (ducted supply and extract)
  - Semi-transverse (hybrid of ducted and non-ducted)

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* Design of tunnel ventilation system 
* 1D / Subway Environment Simulation (SES)
  - Early stages of design
  - Fast computation
  - Provides global averaged prediction
  - Limitations on gas species or high resolution calculations

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* 3D / Full CFD simulation
  - To validate the design carried out at the earlier stages
  - Time consuming
  - Provides high resolution predictions, e.g. gas species and combustion
  - Tunnel section models often shorten to reduce computational time
* Is there a best of both world? 

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* Multi-scale modelling method
* Using 1D for far field tunnel sections
* Full CFD for near field, or tunnel section of interest
* Significantly reduce the computational time
* Off-set computational time for longer tunnel section

# Multi-scale Modelling - What and Why

* Multi-scale modelling method
* Direct and indirect coupling methods
* FDS6.1 is based on indirect coupling method
* Implemented using HVAC feature
  - Acknowledge this is not the intended use of HVAC

# Multi-scale Modelling - Implementation

* Model is based on Dartford Tunnel West
* Cold flow field measurement data available [1]
* Dartford Tunnel West properties: 
  - 1.5 km long
  - 14 jet fans pairs (JFP) with 8.3m^3^/s per fan
* Key of multi-scale model
  - Interface between 1D and full CFD sections
  - Flow need to be fully developed 

# Multi-scale Modelling - Implementation

* L~p~ is length of portal = 50 m
* L~JF,UP~ and L~JF,DW~ are length up and downstream of jet fans = 35 m and 130 m respectively
* L~fire~ is length each side of fire = 170 m
* Calibrated from running multiple models 

# Cold Flow Modelling Results

* Cold flow modelling results presented separately in Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology [3]
* Good correlation from 80 m downwind of the jet fans
* Poorer correlation nearer to jet fans:
  - Lack of detailed information of installed jet fans
  - Difficulty to accurately model the jet fans
  - No accurate measurement of tunnel walls' surface roughness

# Multi-scale Fire Modelling Results

* Adapted from the same cold flow multi-scale model
* Introduction of a fire in the middle of the tunnel
* Three fire sizes considered, 35 MW, 55 MW and 75 MW 
* Validation study conducted (Arup Tunnel case)
* Mass flow rate is the measured variable 
* Interesting behaviour observed in the multi-scale model

# Multi-scale Fire Modelling Results

* Oscillatory mass flow observed
* Mass flow rates in multi-scale models do not stabilise compared to the full CFD model
* It is yet to be determined if the oscillation is numerical
* Similar oscillation for velocity and temperature observed by Vermesi _et al_ [2]

# Conclusion

* Multi-scale modelling using FDS6.1 + HVAC is feasible
* Can be used for cold flow multi-scale modelling
* Fire modelling using the multi-scale model:
  - Oscillating mass flow
  - Mass flow rates do not stabilise compared to the full CFD model
  - Should not be used until the above two questions can be answered
